             <h1>The Drops</h1>
             <p>The Drops was our very first project, which holds a special place in our journey. While it is now retired, it served as a valuable learning experience, reinforcing our understanding of fundamental concepts and fueling our passion for game development. In this game, users controlled a raindrop character and maneuvered it through the sky using their finger. The objective was to avoid colliding with any clouds while collecting coins to achieve a new high score. It was an engaging challenge that motivated players to test their skills and aim for better performances.</p>

             <h1>Quick Click</h1>
             <p>Quick Click marked our entry into the realm of multiplayer-oriented projects. The game encompassed both a single-player mode and a two-player mode. In both modes, players were tasked with rapidly tapping the color that corresponded to a displayed word. The challenge was heightened by the word being presented in a font color that often contradicted its meaning. In the two-player mode, competitors engaged in a head-to-head battle on a shared device, striving to be the first to select the correct color.</p>

             <h1>Smoky Trails</h1>
             <p>Smoky Trails represented a significant leap forward from our initial two games, showcasing enhanced artwork, gameplay mechanics, and programming intricacies. We strived to launch this game just in time for July 4th, capitalizing on the festive spirit. It adopted an arcade-style format, where players were required to tap fireworks to detonate them before they disappeared from the screen. The captivating gameplay and engaging mechanics of Smoky Trails propelled it to become a resounding success, marking a remarkable and enjoyable advancement for Nopri.</p>

             <h1>Fractured</h1>
             <p>Fractured is an upcoming adventure game that incorporates a lighthearted and whimsical tone. Drawing inspiration from older generation game design principles, the game revolves around classic elements like dungeons and utility items that players can utilize to solve puzzles and advance through the game. Rather than following a linear path, Fractured offers players the freedom to choose their starting point and presents them with an upgrade option right from the beginning. However, the availability of this upgrade in the open world is delayed until later in the game.</p>
